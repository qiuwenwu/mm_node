Simple async testing library for node.js.
Better suited to asynchronous tests than other libraries since it uses callbacks to get results.

Now shows results in pretty colors!

## Installation

Just run:
    $ npm install testing

Or add package testing to your package.json dependencies.

## Usage

Add asynchronous testing to your code very easily. Require testing:

```js
var testing = require('testing');
```

### Unit tests

Add a test function to your code, checking if results are what should be expected:
```js
    function testAdd(callback)
    {
		testing.assertEquals(add(1, 1), 2, 'Maths fail', callback);
		testing.success(callback);
    }
```
Run an async test to read the contents of a file and check it is not empty:
```js
    function testAsync(callback)
    {
        function fs.readFile('file.txt', function(error, result)
        {
            if (error)
            {
                testing.failure('File not read', callback);
            }
            testing.assert(result, 'Empty file', callback);
            testing.success(callback);
        });
    }
```
### Running all tests

Run all tests:
```js
    testing.run([
        testAdd,
        testAsync,
    ], callback);
```
Will run tests sequentially. Usually test are run inside an exported function `test`:
```js
    /**
     * Run package tests.
     */
    exports.test = function(callback)
    {   
        var tests = [
            testAdd,
            testAsync,
        ];
        testing.run(tests, callback);
    };  
        
    // run tests if invoked directly
    if (__filename == process.argv[1])
    {   
        exports.test(testing.show);
    }
```
All tests are run every time the file is invoked directly:
```js
    node my-file.js
```
The function `test` is exported so that tests from all source code files
can be required and run in sequence from a master file,
usually called `test.js` and placed in the root of the project.

### Running all tests in a project

If you want to run all tests in a project, you can pass a filename as a test:
```js
    var tests = [
        __dirname__ + '/lib/first.js',
        __dirname__ + '/lib/second.js',
    ];
    testing.run(tests, callback);
```
Each file should have its own exported test function.
This is a common practice in a global test file `test.js`.

## API

Implementation is very easy, based around three functions.

### Basics

Callbacks are used for asynchronous testing. They follow the usual node.js convention:
```js
    callback(error, result);
```
When no callback is passed, synchronous testing is performed.

#### testing.success([message], [callback])

Note success for the current test. An optional message is shown if there is no callback.

If there is a callback, then it is called with the message. Default message: true.

Example:
```js
    testing.success(callback);
```
#### testing.failure([message], [callback])

Note failure for the current test.

If the callback is present, calls the callback with the error:
```js
    callback(message);
```
Otherwise the message is shown using console.error(). Default message: 'Error'.

Example:
```js
    testing.failure('An error happened', callback);
```

#### testing.fail([message], [callback])

Alias to `testing.failure()`.

#### testing.run(tests, [timeout], [callback])

Run a set of tests. The first parameter is an object containing one attribute for every testing function.

The tests are considered as a failure when a certain configurable timeout has passed.
The timeout parameter is in milliseconds. The default is 2 seconds per test.

When the optional callback is given, it is called after a failure or the success of all tests.
The callback has this signature, following the usual Node.js syntax:

    function (error, result) {
        ...
    }

`error` will contain the results of the tests when they fail.
`result` will contain the results when they succeed.

Example:
```js
    testing.run({
        first: testFirst,
        second: testSecond,
    }, 1000, callback);
```
For each attribute, the key is used to display success; the value is a testing function that accepts an optional callback.

Note: testing uses async to run tests in series.

### Asserts

There are several utility methods for assertions.

#### testing.verify(condition, [message], [callback])
#### testing.assert(condition, [message], [callback])

Checks condition; if true, does nothing. Otherwise calls the callback passing the message, if present.

When there is no callback, just prints the message to console.log() for success, console.error() for errors.
Default message: 'Assertion error'.

Example:
```js
    testing.verify(shouldBeTrue(), 'shouldBeTrue() should return a truthy value', callback);
```

#### testing.equals(actual, expected, [message], [callback])
#### testing.assertEquals(actual, expected, [message], [callback])

Check that the given values are equal. Uses weak equality (==).

Message and callback behave just like above.

Example:

```js
    testing.equals(getOnePlusOne(), 2, 'getOnePlusOne() does not work', callback);
```

#### testing.notEquals(actual, unexpected, [message], [callback])
#### testing.assertNotEquals(actual, unexpected, [message], [callback])

Inverse of the above, check that the given values are *not* equal. Uses weak inequality (!=).

#### testing.contains(container, piece, [message], [callback])

Check that the container contains the piece.
Works for strings and arrays.

Message and callback behave just like above.

Example:

    testing.contains('Big string', 'g s', 'Does not contain', callback);

#### testing.check(error, [message], [callback])

Check there are no errors.
Almost the exact opposite of an assertion: if there is an error, count as a failure.
Otherwise, do nothing.

Example:
```js
    testing.check(error, 'There should be no errors', callback);
```
Similar to over the following code:
```js
    testing.assert(!error, 'There should be no errors', callback);
```
But with the advantage that it shows the actual error message should there be one.

### Showing results

You can use your own function to show results. The library provides a premade callback:

#### testing.show(error, result)

Show an error if present, a success if there was no error.

Example:
```js
    testing.run(tests, testing.show);
```
This line can be run at the end of every code file to run its set of tests.

#### testing.showComplete(error, result)

Like `testing.show()`, but shows the complete hierarchical tree of tests.
Test information is therefore duplicated: once shown while running,
another after all tests.

Example:
```js
    exports.test(testing.showComplete);
```
#### testing.toShow(tester)

Returns a function with a callback as parameter,
that runs the tests, shows results and invokes the callback.
Useful to insert in some callback loop.

Example:
```js
    var tasks = [testing.toShow(test1), testing.toShow(test2)];
    async.parallel(tasks, function()
    {
        console.log('All tests run');
    });
```
Runs a couple of tests in parallel, showing their results as they finish.
